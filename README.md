#A Marriage of Science and Javascript#
![Sun Demo](https://github.com/jcharry/SciPlay/blob/master/img/sun.png)

This repo contains a physics engine I'm building for the express purpose of
learning about simulating physics.  That's it.  I don't intend to make this
stable or completely usable (there are a bunch of mature, powerful libraries
already out there, and why reinvent the wheel?).  I do however intend to learn
as much about game physics as I can, and building this library helps me do just
that.

So poke around, check the code out, but know that some things don't work quite
right, because building a working engine is hard.  So please take it with
a grain of salt.

##To build##
Clone the repo
```
$ git clone 
```

Install all dependencies with
```
$ npm install
```

Then run a dev server with
```
$ npm run dev
```

A browser window should open, and you can navigate to the demos folder to see
any demos (many of which are not working!!!).

And that's it!
